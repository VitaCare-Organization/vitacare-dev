     { href: "/about", label: "About" },
   ];

   // Logged In  
   const loggedInNavItems = [
     { href: "/dashboard", label: "Dashboard" },
     { href: "/appointments", label: "Appointments" },
     { href: "/medical-records", label: "Medical Records" },
     { href: "/paymentsDashboard", label: "Payments" },
   ];
   ```

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

- ✅ Integration points

#### Test Files:
```
Header.test.tsx - Main test suite (passing)
└── Component Features
    ├── Logged out state navigation
    ├── Logged in state navigation  
    ├── Mobile responsiveness
    └── Accessibility support
└── Integration
    ├── UserContext integration
    └── Next.js routing
```

### 🚀 Usage

function App() {
  return (
